  <p>Set in New-Manhattan a city rebuilt with Japanese money, the story focuses on two biker friends. Further plot is not known at this time.</p>

<p>My issue is not with non-asian actors (but I kid you not if Robert Patterson takes one of the roles for this movie I will be disappointed in Hollywood, <sub>Even though I already am</sub>), my issue is with the reason why Akira worked. It worked (for me) because I liked the Tokyo setting </p>

<li>Post atomic bomb experiences</li>
<li>Overpopulation</li>
<li>Daily economic struggle</li>

<p>Now it is being moved to New York of which if anything that this will be relatable to would be <em>9/11</em> or an alternate reality where the crime rate reaches uncontrollable levels like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_New_York" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_New_York</a>.

<p>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_2001%3a_A_Space_Odyssey">discussed on Wikipedia</a>, Kubrick stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You''re free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and
  allegorical meaning of the film—and such speculation is one indication
  that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level—but I
  don''t want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer
  will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he''s missed the point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Clarke:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I still stand by this remark, which does not mean one can''t enjoy the
  movie completely the first time around. What I meant was, of course,
  that because we were dealing with the mystery of the universe, and
  with powers and forces greater than man''s comprehension, then by
  definition they could not be totally understandable. Yet there is at
  least one logical structure—and sometimes more than one—behind
  everything that happens on the screen in "2001", and the ending does
  not consist of random enigmas, some simpleminded critics to the
  contrary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freeman Dyson urged:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"After seeing Space Odyssey, I read Arthur Clarke''s book. I found the
  book gripping and intellectually satisfying, full of the tension and
  clarity which the movie lacks. All the parts of the movie that are
  vague and unintelligible, especially the beginning and the end, become
  clear and convincing in the book. So I recommend to my middle-aged
  friends who find the movie bewildering that they should read the book;
  their teenage kids don''t need to."</p>

Confidential</em>, Ed Exley is in a (supposedly) sound-proof interview room, giving a statement to two detectives. He is observed by a group of others, including the chief of police and the DA, who sit outside the room behind a one-way mirror. They supposedly cannot be seen or heard by Exley (a scene from inside the interview room shows only Exley''s reflection on his side of the one-way mirror window).</p>

<p>After Exley finishes his statement and the two detectives leave the room, the police chief and DA confer and we get the following dialogue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DA: Who''s to say what happened? Maybe <em>spoiler</em> died a hero?</p>
  
  <p><em>Exley smirks</em></p>
  
  <p>Police chief: You wanna tell me what you''re smiling about?</p>
  
  <p>Exley: A hero.</p>
  
  <p>Detective 1 (outside interview room): How did he know what we were talking about?</p>
  
  <p>Detective 2 (outside interview room): He couldn''t have heard us.</p>
  
  <p>Police chief: And?</p>
  
  <p>Exley: In this situation, you''ll need more than one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you watch the film carefully, it goes to great lengths to show us that Exley cannot hear the DA''s line of dialogue:</p>

<ul>
<li>We clearly hear the door to the interview room close as the two detectives leave, well before the DA''s "hero" line. A subsequent shot from inside the room confirms that the door is closed.</li>
<li>In the shot of the DA and the police chief having their "hero" conversation, the intercom button they need to press to be heard inside the interview room is in clear view in the foreground, and is not being pressed.</li>
<li>The police chief''s first line ("You wanna tell me...") is heard from within the interview room, but we clearly hear the intercom engaging before it and disengaging afterwards. For his "And?" line we''re outside the interview room and actually see him press the intercom button. (By implication, if the intercom is not used they can''t be heard.)</li>
<li>And of course, the two detectives comment on it explicitly.</li>
</ul>

  a rare neuropsychiatric disorder in which people hold a delusional
  belief that they are dead (either figuratively or literally), do not
  exist, are putrefying, or have lost their blood or internal organs. In
  rare instances, it can include delusions of immortality.</p>

I noticed that during a lot of dialogue scenes with only two or three people, there will often only be one of the characters in the shot. It gave me the impression that those characters'' lines were shot separately and then edited back into the scene, but I''m not sure that that''s actually the reason why they are shot this way. </p>

<p>An example off the top of my head is the scene in Gertrude Stein''s salon when we first meet Adriana, the Marion Cotillard character. She is standing in the doorway of the salon while everyone critiques Picasso''s portrait of her. During her lines, she is the only person in the frame, and if I recall correctly she doesn''t have any off camera lines, either.</p>

<p>You can almost see it in <a href="http://movieclips.com/n3ALF-midnight-in-paris-movie-exceptionally-lovely/">this video</a> but it stops too soon. (I will keep looking for a more demonstrative clip.) The rest of Adriana''s shots in that scene are framed exactly like that first shot of her, close in on her, with no other people in the shot and no movement from the camera. It gives me the impression that she isn''t really a part of the rest of the scene, like we''re cutting to somewhere else when we''re looking at her. </p>

<p>Is this a choice, or were there simply scenes that had to be re-shot later and so they ended up a little funky? I''m not a big Woody Allen buff - is this something that he does frequently? If so, what is the purpose of shooting specific bits of dialogue like this?</p>

<p>Update:<br>
I found <a href="http://vimeo.com/30397719">another clip</a> that sort of demonstrates this. It''s when Gil first meets Salvador Dalí in the restaurant. I''m not sure this is the same cut that''s in the film - I don''t remember that long of a shot on Dalí when we first meet him and sit down at the table. But regardless of that issue, once we get into the scene, Gil''s two lines ("Rhinoceros?" and "complex situation") are shot in the same isolated way as Adriana''s first scene.</p>', 1756, 112, CAST(N'2012-07-23T16:08:24.067' AS DateTime), CAST(N'2012-07-23T16:08:24.067' AS DateTime), N'What''s with the "one-sided" dialogue scenes in Midnight in Paris?', N'<analysis><midnight-in-paris>', CAST(N'2012-02-15T15:20:29.177' AS DateTime))

<p>There are a few important things we know about Initech that the movie plot hinged on.  Are there any real-life companies that actually fit this criteria?</p>

<ol>
<li>Initech hires computer programmers that "update bank software for the 2000 switch"</li>
<li>Initech has access to "the credit union software"</li>
<li>Initech has access to "the credit union mainframe"</li>
<li>Initech''s accounting department notices when the money goes missing</li>
<li>Initech has a "Corporate Accounts Payable" department (although <a href="http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Office-Space.html">at least one transcriber disagrees with me</a> and thinks it''s "Corporate Councils Payroll")</li>
<li>Initech has a "Logistics" department</li>
<li>Initech has engineers who lack people skills sufficient to interface directly with their customers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Items 1,2,7 make Initech sound like a software development house that contracts with financial institutions.  Item 3 additionally makes Initech sound like a company that contracts with financial institutions for server and software maintenance.</p>

<p>Item 4 makes Initech sound like the actual financial institution.</p>

<p>Item 5 sounds more like a consulting firm, as I think "accounts payable" is more likely simply called "loans"; but an actual banker could probably clear this up.</p>

<p>Item 6 could probably be either a bank or a consulting firm.</p>

<p>I would think maybe Initech is simply a subsidiary of a large financial corporation, that does in-house IT consulting and programming for the parent company.  But item 7 doesn''t fit with this theory, as then there wouldn''t be any real "customers" (in a traditional sense).</p>

At the end of the movie, Leamas is let out of his cell by Mundt and provided with a car.  Mundt also lets Leamas'' lover, Nan, escape with him.  Mundt knows, however, that Leamas is going to tell Nan everything, which is why he has the boy shoot her as she and Leamas are climbing over the wall.  When Leamas sees that Nan has been shot, he decides that he doesn''t want to go on living without her, climbs back to the East German side, and gets shot.</p>

<p>Why was Nan released in the first place, however?  Leamas seems to believe, in his final monologue, that it was part of a deal, and that Mundt believed that he wouldn''t leave without her, a belief that is justified in the last minute of the film.  But it seems to me that Leamas would be more likely to accept life as a Nan-less spy if she was ditched in East Germany than if she was shot by a fellow British agent.  Furthermore, a more convincing argument for his return could have been made by Mundt at the gate than the one Smiley and the boy attempt to make in the last lines of the film.</p>

<p>It would also have been better for Mundt to keep Nan in East Germany, because it makes the escape less suspicious.  The Soviets will easily believe that Fiedler''s co-conspirators helped Leamas escape, because Leamas was working for them and they owed it to him, and the official explanation is that Leamas and Fiedler were working together to incriminate Mundt, so it makes sense that Fiedler''s friends would help him escape.  What makes less sense, however, is Fiedler''s friends helping Nan escape - they owe nothing to her, and Nan was the girl who unraveled their entire plot.  They have no motive for saving her other than that Leamas wants them to, and that motive is non-consequential enough that the story Mundt will provide would make sense without letting Nan go.</p>

In a somewhat unorthodox fashion, however, many of the original actors/actresses that Andy crossed paths with were called back to assist with the re-creation of those very same scenes. </p>

<p>So, aside from the obvious amount of time that has passed (the actors and actresses clearly all look a bit older) the scenes are more-or-less exact replicas of what happened in Andy''s past. This includes many cameos from the cast of Taxi, wrestler Jerry Lawler, SNL Producer Lorne Michaels, David Letterman and more. There are most certainly some actors that weren''t able to reprise their roles, for various reasons (the scene wasn''t important enough, the original actor wasn''t available/dead/etc), but there was one key actor missing who could have reprised his role--for a very significant scene: Michael Richards, in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_xqiCeIFws">the "Friday''s" incident</a>.</p>

<p>Back in ''81, Andy appeared on a live sketch comedy show which attempted to take advantage of the success of Saturday Night Live. It was comprised of young comedians getting their start in the industry, and performing sketches on live TV, much in the same fashion as SNL. On one particular night, a sketch involving four friends (one of which was played by Andy Kaufman, another by Michael Richards) took place at a restaurant, with the joke being that they would get up at various times and head to the bathroom to smoke marijuana. About half-way through this sketch, Kaufman decided for whatever reason to go off script, infuriating and frustrating his fellow cast members. At one point, Richards goes off camera and returns with the sketch''s cue cards, and tosses them on the table in front of Kaufman, at which point Kaufman sprays Richards with a glass of water, causing even more friction, and an eventual fight breaks out between Kaufman and Friday''s co-producer Jack Burns.</p>

<p>Andy was known for unconventional humor. Throughout his career, he made a lot of judgment calls about what he thought was true comedy, but that not very many other people seemed to agree on. One recurring theme in his comedy was that <strong>he liked to keep the audience guessing</strong>. Was what we were seeing really real? Or was it all an elaborate hoax? A staged event that really truly seems like it is actually happening, only to find out later that it was a sham from the start. </p>

<p>Many people that Kaufman staged these "events" with now confirm today that they were, in fact, staged; the most famous of which could be considered the entire series of events that took place between wrestler Jerry Lawler and Kaufman. And, as expected, in the case of the "Friday''s" incident, it was also revealed later that the entire scene...Kaufman going off script, Richards'' frustration, the cue-cards, the water splashing and eventual fight...all was a plan from the beginning. Richards himself confirms this in an episode of <a href="http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083">"Speaking Freely"</a> (<a href="http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/flash/display_video.aspx?id=20695">Video</a>).</p>

<p>Even though people confirm that these Kaufman-events were planned from the start, one very real fact remains: out of all of the actors/actresses that ever had the luxury of coming into contact and dealing with Kaufman, and were given the opportunity to return and pay homage to Andy by recreating those same scenes in the "Man on the Moon" film, one person refused: <em>Michael Richards</em>. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The question is, why?</strong></p>

<p>If, like so many other actors, Richards had truly been "in" on the event from the start, then shouldn''t he, as a comedian, understand the value of that comedic genius and want to pay homage to it like others? Or was there another reason that kept Richards from participating, other than the most basic guesses of <em>"it was an embarrassment for him"</em>, or <em>"he simply didn''t want to re-live the past"</em>, or even <em>"his schedule simply didn''t allow for him to contribute to the movie"</em> (which seems unlikely). </p>

<p>Is there any proof available to the story that the event, though portrayed after the fact as a hoax, may have truly been, in fact, something that Kaufman came up with on-the-fly, and the network/people involved simply used "oh, it was planned" as a cover for them losing control of Kaufman on live TV--and that the <em>real</em> reason Richards refused to portray himself in that infamous scene was due to the fact that <strong>he knew the truth</strong>...that Kaufman embarrassed Richards and his fellow cast members on live TV without their knowledge, and to this day, will really have nothing to do with any homage paying tribute to Kaufman? </p>', 165, 1199, CAST(N'2013-07-02T11:43:07.893' AS DateTime), CAST(N'2013-07-02T11:43:07.893' AS DateTime), N'Why did Michael Richards refuse to portray himself?', N'<analysis><comedy><cinema-history><man-on-the-moon>', CAST(N'2012-03-07T20:10:52.817' AS DateTime))

<p>Seems like for most of the day the kids were locked in their adjacent rooms, and were not supposed to make any noise or else be punished.

But is it real? More specifically, <strong>what evidence proves the scoring battles of <em>King of Kong</em> really happened?</strong></p>

<p>If you haven''t seen it, the movie''s main characters are the perfect David/Goliath contrast... one a super-nice teacher guy down on his luck, the other an arrogant, smug, successful-small-business jerkwad with a mullet. And the good guy wins in the end!</p>

<p>But looking back, the <em>King of Kong</em> story and especially those characters seemed a little too perfect. So I looked into things on the ''net. </p>

<p>A few minutes of Googling led to articles and even some photos (like the one below) appearing to confirm that the Billy Mitchell character is real and has been in gaming for awhile. 
<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VYNZH.jpg" alt="Billy Mitchell 1982 (?)"></p>

<p>But photos are easy to fake. That one of Bily Mitchell could have been easily forged in Photoshop using an old photo of the actor who played Mitchell. And look closely at his sweatshirt... the C in Centipede seems oddly cut-off, no?</p>

<p>And when I dug further on the ''net, I noticed <strong>much of the material confirming the scoring battles appears to come from just a few sources</strong>, most notably TwinGalaxies.com, the website mentioned extensively in the movie. For instance, many of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Kong%3a_A_Fistful_of_Quarters#cite_note-newhighscore-26" rel="nofollow">the gaming-history-related Wikipedia references for the movie</a> come from "articles" on TwinGalaxies.com. This site and its contents easily could have been created by the movie''s makers.</p>

<p>Then there''s other evidence suggesting <em>King of Kong</em> is a mockumentary:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tagline for the movie -- "Don''t get chumpatized" -- seems less
appropo for the movie as a documentary but very appropo for the movie
as a mockumentary </li>
<li>The movie references a character called "Mister Awesome" who seems like he would have a significant Internet presence, but basically all that exists is <a href="http://www.royawesome.com/" rel="nofollow">a half-assed website</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3gW_91bjkg" rel="nofollow">a Youtube video with footage from the movie repackaged as a fake news-show segment</a></li>
<li>Director Seth Gordon is no stranger to comedy,
having directed an episode each of Modern Family and Community, two
episodes of The Office, and multiple episodes of Parks and
Recreation.</li>
<li>(update 1) YouTube has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62Z1lqiNSkk" rel="nofollow">short clip of 1983 "That''s Incredible" episode</a> which purports to show Walter Day hosting video game tourney, but clip''s edits seem strange, and more importantly: no Billy Mitchell</li>
</ul>

<p>(update 2) Evidence suggesting King of Kong is real:</p>

<ul>
<li>according to <a href="http://www.2neatmagazines.com/life/1980-84.html" rel="nofollow">this site that describes old Life magazines</a>, the January 1983 issue did include story on video-game high-scorers, including Billy Mitchell.</li>

The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep7W89I_V_g" rel="nofollow">video (a copy on youtube)</a> is the subject of a question I''ve been trying to get answered for nearly as long as it''s been in release. (see links 1 and 2 at bottom)</p>

<p>The video for this song features the band layered over a science fiction movie. A child receives a key on his birthday from a mysterious man with an alien voice stating that it will answer his questions as to why his father had to leave. He discovers a hidden room in the house with a cube of FVX in it that eventually has his father explaining some space invasion/war that he had to go fight in.</p>

<p>The simple question is: did the movie suggested/previewed by the video ever exist (even if it got shelved and never released) and of course, if so... what was it?</p>

<p>The song did appear in the soundtrack to "On Dangerous Ground" which released in the US as "Choke Canyon." While a scene from this film seems hastily inserted in the video; "Choke Canyon" has nothing to do with the Science Fiction plot suggested by the bulk of the video.</p>

<p>Some are quick to point out that "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running" rel="nofollow">Silent Running</a>" was indeed a science fiction film. This is referring to the Bruce Dern space-ecological film of the early 1970s. This film also thematically is completely different front he material of the video.</p>

<p>Finally, is the suggestion of whether the scenes were produced specifically for the video. The lyrics of the song to compliment the theme of the video. The inserts of the band seem layered onto existing footage. The song itself seems like it was written for another movie. And it''s hard to believe that the money necessary for some of the effects (for the time) would have been spent strictly for a video. Especially considering that this song was the first release for the band.</p>

It seems loosely that cast (in order of today''s "big name" significance), directors and financiers get the front spots, and everything else appears later.  But lately I''ve been developing some specific curiosities about how cast members are credited on TV shows.</p>

<p>Opening credits seem to follow this rough outline:</p>

<p>Part of "opening credits" video segment</p>

<ol>
<li>(optional) Major Actors</li>
<li>Show Title</li>
<li>Core Cast Actors</li>
<li>Directors</li>
<li>Producers</li>
<li>(optional) Episode Title</li>
<li>Episode Writers</li>
</ol>

<p>Subtitles over beginning of show, after opening video</p>

<ol>
<li>(Episode Title and Writers may appear here, instead)</li>
<li>Special Guest Actors</li>
</ol>

<p>I''ve probably missed a few things, and mis-ordered a few things.  But, as I said, my main curiosity is about actor credits.</p>

<p>Typically, there is little indication of which characters the core cast actors play.  Sometimes their name is edited to appear along with an image of the character as an indictator, but sometimes there is no indication.  As I''ve never seen anyone credited in both the opening and closing credits, that leaves the potential for core actors to never be directly associated with their character.  This seems potentially problematic; is there a reason for this?  Are viewers expected to know who''s who?</p>

<p>Guest actors sometimes are simply credited by name (and not being part of the opening video, this means they will never be associated with their character in credits).  But often they are credited as "<strong>special guest</strong> as <strong>character name</strong>".  This is quite helpful.</p>

<p>The thing I find really confusing is, sometimes the last few regular cast actors will get the guest actor treatment.  I''ve seen opening video with "and <strong>actor</strong> as <strong>character</strong>" paired with an image of that character for an entire season.  Why does this actor get special treatment?</p>

<p>Finally, sometimes guest actors will be credited at the front following the opening video, sometimes they''ll be credited in the closing credits.  Are there rules for deciding who get''s credited early or late?</p>

<p>I''ve sometimes wondered if shows deliberately play with actor''s name position to obfuscate plot arcs ("you won''t think we''re killing of this character if their actor is still in the opening credits", or "you won''t expect this recurring guest if we place their name in the closing credits") and I''ve also wondered if there are thresholds for "people appearing in XX number or YY percentage of episodes get placed <strong>here</strong>."  But it''s difficult to build a good sampling base for this.  And season 7 of Stargate SG-1 kinda took a shotgun to my guesses so far.</p>

<p>So...  Are there rules?</p>', 1079, 1442, NULL, CAST(N'2013-12-28T13:10:24.907' AS DateTime), N'What rules govern how TV show opening credits are structured?', N'<casting><credits><tv-shows>', CAST(N'2012-04-06T22:51:18.233' AS DateTime))

He could just have left him blind or do whatever to him.

<p>He tells <em>Anderton</em> something about learning new things in prison and finding himself, but this sounded a bit sarcastic and I don''t really believe he was actually happy to have been imprisoned.</p>

<p>Am I correct in thinking that children who make films which are rated at a particular age rating cannot actually <strong>see</strong> the movie until they are of said age?</p>

<p>For example: let us assume that John, aged 8, has played a major part in a horror movie (Movie X), where he was filmed in a number of scary scenes involving lots of blood, gore and some swearing.  However, upon classification, the BBFC decided that a rating of 15 was suitable for Movie X.  Therefore, will John not be allowed to see his "own movie" until he is at least 15 years of age even though he acted in the gory scenes?</p>

<p>Logically, I would say no, John is not allowed to see said movie until he is of age; however, that statement in itself is illogical, given the background history of the movie as he starred in many gory and horrific scenes.</p>

<p>My question is: which would be the most accurate assumption?

<p>Doing some general scanning and research, I keep coming across the <a href="http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2011/09/houses-hugh-laurie-on-lisa-edelsteins-departure-shows-premature-swan-song.html">same thing</a> of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Lisa''s departure came out of left field in my world, too," Laurie says. "I don''t know who was privy to what at what time, but it was a great shock to me and everyone obviously misses her very greatly. Not only was she a great asset to the show as a performer, but we also just miss her company, because she is an absolute hoot to have around. She has been snapped up by another show and damn right, they''d be nuts not to. I hope she is having a great time, and I am sure she is."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is also the <a href="http://tvline.com/2011/08/05/house-season-8-spoilers-cuddy/">reaction</a> of the creator, David Shore:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was not our plan to lose Lisa. It is not what we had in our mind. Certain stuff got thrust upon us that I was not pleased with. </p>

<p>I highly doubt a role on <em>The Good Wife</em> for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0249046/"><em>3 episodes</em></a>, like I''ve seen in some places, was the sole reason for her departure and refusal to participate in the finale.</p>', 629, 1186, CAST(N'2013-07-02T12:30:02.600' AS DateTime), CAST(N'2013-07-08T11:40:39.803' AS DateTime), N'Why did Lisa Edelstein not return for the final season of House?', N'<character><casting><house>', CAST(N'2012-07-02T00:22:41.387' AS DateTime))

<p>I''ve been watching a lot of older films lately (older, in this instance reads "circa 80''s and 70''s" and mainly in the Sci-Fi and action genres), and have been asking myself the same thing as I watch each one.</p>

<p><em>Note: I''m watching these on DvD or Blu-Ray, they''re not rips or VHS tapes if that makes any difference.</em></p>

<p>I''ve noticed that a lot of these films have their soundtrack''s mixed in a very particular way. I''ve noticed that the musical queues and sound effects seem to be mixed at a higher volume than the dialogue. I the versions of the films that I have and watch, at least.</p>

<p>As an example, I''ve recently watched the UK version of the Blu-Ray release of Aliens, and I found that I had to turn my sound system up quite high to hear the dialogue, but turn it back down again during the action sequences (or scenes with lots of sound effects or musical queues) as I have room-mates and don''t wish to disturb them just so that I can hear the dialogue.</p>

<p>I''m convinced that it''s not my sound system, as a lot of the films from the same era seem to be mixed the same way. Also, playing them back through my PC, I notice the same thing.</p>

<p>Is this related to a stylistic decision made by the director/sound engineer? A technical limitation of the technology of the time? Is it related to potential problems with converting the (I''m guessing) analogue soundtrack to a digital format and compressing it?</p>

<p>I know (from a very limited knowledge of how it works) that Dolby is an encoding format aimed at reducing hiss, and that one of the ways it can achieve this is by lowering the overall volume of the soundtrack to a point where hiss isn''t as easily detectable. So, I''m guessing that this might just be a by-product of that encoding process.</p>

Rear Window is one of his greatest and most influential films. Throughout, the viewer is at the mercy of Hitchcock, as he has already decided where you will look, what you will see, and maybe even what you will think or feel. From the perspective of Jeff''s wheelchair, the viewer becomes a voyeur observing the the lives and relationships of his neighbors.</p>

<p><strong>The dichotomy of relationships presented in Rear Window include:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Jeff and Lisa:<br>
Lisa wants to settle down, get married. Jeff wants to remain together, but <em>not</em> marry. He appreciates his independence and the freedom his job as a news photographer provides him (a profession Lisa wants him to abandon for something more stable).</p></li>
<li><p>Old married couple:<br>
Their lives, from the POV of the viewer are repetitive and largely-routine</p></li>
<li><p>The young married couple:<br>
Their on-screen* time bounces from excited newlyweds to what appears to be useless banter.
<br>*Note that much of what we the viewer observe about them is not on- but off-screen, merely through dialogue heard through the window.</p></li>
<li><p>The ballerina:<br>
She is entertaining (what appear to be) potential suitors throughout the movie, until the end when her (especially nerdy looking) boyfriend/husband comes home.</p></li>
<li><p>''Miss Lonelyhearts''<br>
A single woman living by herself, intent on finding a partner. She eventually goes on a date with a forceful man who she kicks out her apartment. Lisa and Jeff are especially interested in her, and express great concern for her safety when they believe she commits suicide. Near the finale of the movie, we see ''Miss Lonelyhearts'' enchanted by music she hears coming from an apartment above her-- the partying musician-- and the viewer is left to assume they live happily ever after.</p></li>
<li><p>The Thorwalds<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Thorwald (an invalid) fight often and loud-- until they suddenly don''t. Jeff and Lisa pay more attention to them than anyone else in their view. This relationship and the one between Jeff and Lisa are the primary focus of Rear Window.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hitchcock has given us, the viewer: a beautiful single woman, an old single woman, a newly-married couple, a old couple, a ''middle of the road'' married couple and Jeff and Lisa-- whose status is passively changing throughout the film. Some are desperate to find a partner, while others are desperate to maintain their freedom. Is he saying that relationships have a life of their own, that all are different? That happiness is unattainable/attainable? That we put too much emphasis on our relationships? That marriage is an end to work toward? Or that autonomy and freedom are what saves us?</p>

<p>The movie starts with a cat, and some girl''s voice saying "help me". The cat gets then caught and ends up at an anti-smoking  organization, and the movie then focuses at a man consulting the organization. That organization has some "electro-cage", which they demonstrate with the cat, and which makes whoever is inside "dance" through electric shocks. They say that it the man smokes again, they''ll put his wife into that cage, if it happens again, his daughter, and if it happens yet again, they''ll send someone to rape his wife. To the question of what happens if he smokes yet again afterwards, he opened his jacket, but I couldn''t recognize what was inside; it must have been something that answered the question. The man tries not to smoke, but ultimately fails to do so, and they put his wife in the cage. Then the cat escapes, and the voice of the girl again says "help me".

<p>They are (from the official <a href="http://www.nbc.com/americas-got-talent/about/" rel="nofollow">NBC site</a>):</p>

<p>Executive producers: Simon Cowell, Cecile Frot-Coutaz, Ken Warwick, Jason Raff, and Georgie Hurford-Jones</p>

<p>Co-executive producers: Nikki Boella, James McKinlay, Tabitha Hanson-Obtulowicz</p>

<p>Executive in Charge of Production: Tiffany Hoss, Charlie Krestul</p>

<p>Now I understand Simon Cowell and Ceicle Frot-Coutaz.  He is head of the production company SYCO TV, and she is the CEO of FremantleMedia North America, which produce the show.   And Ken Warwick is an executive producer and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner" rel="nofollow">showrunner</a> for American Idol.  (Not clear if he is is also a showrunner at AGT.)</p>

<p>But who are all these other seven EPs?  None of them have entries in Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer" rel="nofollow">executive producer entry in Wikipedia</a> indicates there can be several types of executive producer: traditional EPs (production executives, financiers, etc.), head writer(s), and showrunner(s).</p>

<p>I can''t see how there could be more than one head writer -- host Nick Cannon is the only one that appears to have a script.  AGT is making a ton of money, so it wouldn''t seem there would need to be a lot of investors.</p>

While the movie retains most of the dialogue and several tones of the book, one giant contrast is now present to me.</p>

<p>In the book, the ending goes similar to how the movie occurs.  However, one glaring difference  is while in the movie, the Narrator shoots himself through the cheek, doing this kills Tyler, and he and Marla stand atop the building, watching the destruction caused by Project Mayhem in a seemingly (while twisted) peaceful ending.</p>

<p>In the book, however, The Narrator shoots himself, but is then put into a mental health facility until the end of his days.</p>

<p>To me, this seems like a heavy contrast and much more depressing ending to the story compared with the movie version.</p>

<p>Also in the book, there is more hostility towards the Narrator when he tries to stop Project Mayhem while near the end of the movie, they seem to "forgive" him by bringing Marla to him.</p>

At the end of each episode, everything that had happened was completely and forgotten, and the show effectively "reset" for the next episode. This included not just the obvious sit-coms, but also dramatic shows like sci-fi, cop shows, etc. I don''t remember any show that stands out as paying the least attention to "continuity".</p>

<p>The only deviation here were soap operas, which were just a bunch of overlapping, long-running storylines woven together, but those seemed to be the exception to the rule, and only a handful showed up on prime time.</p>

<p>By the late 90s it seemed like there was a change, to the point where everything <em>but</em> sit-coms were more serialized. Episodes were still self-contained but also fit together into longer, multi-episode, season-wide or even multi-season story arcs. Things that happened in one episode would be written in to subsequent episodes on a regular basis.</p>

<p>For some reason, the two shows that always stick in my brain when I think about this are <em>Golden Girls</em> (one of the last shows I remember from living at home) vs. <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> (one of the first shows I remember from living on my own.) and how dramatically different those shows treated continuity. These days, most dramatic television seems to make at least some effort to be internally consistent from show to show.</p>

<p>Am I just mis-remembering the kind of TV that was popular up through the 90s? Were there a lot of quality serial-type shows on at that time that I just never saw or have since forgotten? Or was there really a shift in the type of programming that made it to prime time teleivsion, and if so, why did that happen?</p>

<p>(Also, I should point out that I''m specifically not counting things like major cast changes, which would be <em>impossible</em> for a show to ignore, but rather that <em>events</em> that happened in one episode are never brought up again, even when they would be relevant, or that there was no cross-episode plots that linked them together.)</p>

<p>UPATE:</p>

<p>Several comments have pointed out how much riskier serial dramas are than episodic ones from the network''s perspective. That makes sense, especially when you factor in syndication deals later on. That might explain the my lack of memory of such dramas on television in previous decades. However, it doesn''t explain why so many dramas on television <em>are</em>  serialized.</p>', 856, 451, CAST(N'2012-07-06T14:13:25.053' AS DateTime), CAST(N'2014-05-06T16:37:17.687' AS DateTime), N'When/Why did American television change from primarily episodic to primarily serialized?', N'<tv-shows><continuity>', CAST(N'2012-08-26T17:54:22.057' AS DateTime))

<p>The second act was in 16-bit video-game style—which <em>Community</em> had recently done—and the gag was that the professor’s fancy microscope was able to zoom to a super-microscopic level, allowing him to see the smallest form of matter in all its “beautiful, intricate, detailed” glory and thus allowed him to discover a grand-unified-theory. The gag of course being that because the segment was in 16-bit, we could not see the detail the professor mentioned and only saw a single pixel.</p>

<p>Plot 1: The hero and heroine meet each other and fall in love and due to some turn of events get separated geographically and are remaining apart. In the course of the movie they are in their run to meet each other.</p>

where each find a perfect match for themselves. During the night something happens
(Cant remember exactly what one of them, or someone else gets kidnapped and they have
to go find them) They go out at night searching and witness witches and other creatures
(including a pumpkin on a stick wearing a raggedy shirt) travelling along a road into 
the woods. They decide to follow them and come across a very Strange tavern, the tavern 
has a waterwheel which when they first come across it digs into the ground in order to 
turn the tavern around 360 degrees after which the door opens and smoke comes out of  
the chimney.

    Inside they find various nightmarish creatures drinking and smoking and partying. 
After a while the barman makes a concoction of various powders and liquids which he 
places in front of a pair of boots. The drink is then lifted by an invisible force and 
consumed above the pair of boots revealing a huge red head with legs and arms (i 
believe its supposed to be the devil)

    Various things happen after that, the 3 guys end up beating up the creatures and 
returning happily to the village of women.

<ul>
<li>the movie had a very creepy atmosphere, and the image seemed to be quite desaturated if not black and white</li>
<li>a guy was having some weird dreams (or visions?), including an ominous figure walking behind some pillars; the dreams always stopped before he could see who it was</li>
<li>there were some messed up mirrors in a building, showing and/or doing horrible things (I think including killing people); apparently there was another world behind them, with a demon or several demons</li>
<li>a demon was trying to come out into the real world, and several characters were trying to stop it</li>
<li>the part I remember most clearly: in one scene, a girl went to a mirror and the demon was kinda swimming towards her from the other side; they joined hands, then the girl went into the mirror, somehow pushing the demon away; then I think the guy (who was in the room) smashed the mirror; I understood this as a self-sacrifice of the girl</li>
<li>and the really creepy ending: the guy is having that weird dream again, and now he can see the figure - it''s the girl from the previous scene</li>
</ul>

<p>In Episode 2x06, where they all become famous as the <em>ASBO Five</em>, Simon follows Alisha to the hidden flat of future Simon (aka <em>"the guy in the mask"</em>). She then tells him that he actually will become that mysterious figure that jumps around and saves them all.</p>

<p>Later in that episode the milk guy kills most of the characters which leads Curtis to <strong>rewind time several weeks back</strong> where they presumably kill the milk guy before he becomes famous in the first place.</p>

<p>Alisha never told Curtis (or any of the others) about the flat or the true identity of the mask guy, so Curtis would not remember after rewinding time. Simon loses all knowledge that he gathered in those rewinded weeks, so he should not be aware of his destiny either.</p>

<p>However, in the next episode (titled <em>''Christmas special''</em>) we see <strong>Simon jumping around on rooftops, trying to learn Parkour</strong> and being <strong>in the flat with Alisha</strong> where they are obviously a couple now.</p>

<p>In this timeline however Alisha would not have had any reason to break her promise and tell Simon the truth, because this time he did not confront her.</p>

Instead, the injection (and whatever other treatment) he is given sends him deep into his mind and his memory, allowing him to mentally re-visit the world he grew up in vividly enough to deliver to the scientists the information they need from the past.

Photographs or casual references made by other characters do not count either.  The actor must have actually had a role, and been physically present in front of the camera, in a movie or TV production associated with each of the three <code>Star-*</code> franchises:  Star Wars, Star Trek, and Stargate.</p>

<p>What makes me think like this because of the following theory.
Crawford is incredibly rich and he can afford that, he planed for several months before the murder, investigating Beachum''s background and by letting Wooton &amp; Simms offer such a dream job to Beachum he can gain some advantages...

<p>b) She told Beachum that he had only two weeks before flying to Chigago for a lawsuit (the client being a big corporation), while in normal case transition from criminal law to corporate attorney requires several months, that forced heavy pressures on Beachum, who was afraid to lose the opportunity.  </p>

<p>c) She refused to help when Beachum was trying to get a court order to keep Jennifer on life support, and said <code>It has nothing to do with Wooton &amp; Simms</code>.

<p>The show was about a room, I think an attic, where there was a large standing mirror, I think oval of shape. I don''t know exactly how, but that mirror somehow connected the normal world (set in the here and now) to another world.</p>

<p>This world ''on the other side of the mirror'' had a medieval-based setting, but with some fantasy elements. I remember the classic ''good vs. evil'' being the main concept the story was revolved around. Some details and fragments that I rememer:</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the ''bad guys'' gets a magical or mechanical glove that she can shoot electrical bolts with, making her powerful and feared.</li>
<li>The intro of the show contains (or perhaps entirely exists of) the magical mirror and a cloudy sky as a background.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>...in 1950...This information was collected on a device that was attached to a television that recorded what was being watched.  In 1953, the company began sending out diaries to a smaller sample of homes (“Nielsen families”) within the survey to have them record what they had watched</p>

<p>So, presumably as multiple different viewers in the home were considered in the sample, the means through which the ratings were recorded changed.</p>

<p>Given that so many people are able to record shows digitally and watch when convenient and that so many view their favorites on outlets such as iTunes, how have the Nielsen ratings systems adapted (or how does the company plan to adapt them) to capture our modern viewing preferences?</p>

What I understood is, If person A is in present as a looper, he would be sent to Past where he would wait for the victim from the present and would kill him so that he can easily dispose of the dead body in the past. Then he would return to present again.</p>

<p>So when a loop is being closed, the looper has to kill his own future-self. But how is it done?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: After getting a clear answer by @Dforck42 about closing a loop, my question changes a little. So when a contract with a looper comes to an end, the present looper kills his future self in present which is sent from future. Now I am trying to set up an example to clarify what I am trying to ask regarding this concept. </p>

<p>Suppose Abe decides to end the loop of person A in present. Then the future self of A has to be sent from future to present by future Abe. So how can the future Abe know that A should be sent to the particular past say 30yrs back, i.e. present from movies perspective? Somebody should inform the future Abe that A''s loops is being closed in present. Then only future Abe can know that A should now be sent to present.

<p>I am a fan of the films, but not a <strong><em>FAN</em></strong> in the truest sense, so I have no idea how this will impact the overall arc of the timeline. </p>

<p>As far as I am aware, some quarters are up in arms over this announcement, and my questions are: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the major issues with having all of these films placed in one universe?</p></li>
<li><p>Has there been any official explanation as to how the filmmakers intend to integrate the loose threads into this new film?</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> There seems to be some confusion about the Professor X character regarding how he ended up in the wheelchair, also the Emma Frost character arc doesn''t appear to work across the timeframe, and there also seem to be issues with Woverine''s relationship to Sabretooth. These are just a few of the ''issues'' raised that I have seen.</p>

<p><em>Here are some more:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In X-Men, Professor Xavier claims he met Erik Lehnsherr when he was 17, in X-Men: First Class he is considerably older during their first meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>In X-Men, Prof X seems confused as to how Magneto has found a way to shield himself from Cerebro, but in X-Men: First Class, Xavier sees Magneto''s helmet and knows what it can do.</p></li>
<li><p>In X-Men, Prof X says that he and Magneto collaborated on the construction of Cerebro, but in X-Men: First Class, Cerebro was designed by Hank (Beast). The original was constructed by the CIA, and whichever version ends up at the X Mansion is of unknown origin but was definitely built after the Xavier/Magneto split.</p></li>
<li><p>In X-Men, we wee a different X Mansion from the one that appears in X-Men: First Class. <strong><em>OK, so they moved. I can relate to that :)</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p>In X-Men, Prof X doesn''t seem to remember meeting Wolverine before, though they meet briefly in X-Men: First Class.</p></li>
<li><p>In X-Men: First Class, Emma Frost (White Queen) meets and is an adversary of Charles Xavier. In X-Men Origins: Wolverine, she doesn''t seem to know him and follows him onto a helicopter without comment or complaint. <strong><em>This one might have been answered below.</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p>In X-Men 3: The Last Stand, Prof X and Magneto are seen visiting the home of Jean Grey to recruit her to the school. This scene presumably takes place many years after the end of X-Men: First Class, where we see the rift between Xavier and Magneto has already taken place.</p></li>
<li><p>In X-Men: First Class we see Hank turn into the blue furry Beast as a young man in the year 1963. In X2: X-Men United Dr. Hank McCoy appears in a television interview and he is not blue and furry.</p></li>

I get hooked on them and then watch all the episodes available in a day or two, while it would take weeks to watch all the episodes of a typical successful American sitcom.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>the British version of <strong>The Office</strong> only had 14 total episodes.  The U.S. version of <strong>The Office</strong> currently has almost 200.</li>
<li>The show <strong>Coupling</strong> lasted for only 4 seasons and 28 episodes, while <strong>Friends</strong> ran for 10 seasons and over 200 episodes. (I know this isn''t the same show, but thought they were comparable)</li>
<li><strong>The IT Crowd</strong>, which I also found hilarious, sadly ran for only 24 episodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now one of the benefits of these shows producing fewer episodes is that the writers don''t seem to run out of ideas and there are no "Jump the Shark" plotlines. But surely there are more good stories to be told about these characters, aren''t there?</p>

<p>This is the scene where the Fat Lady disappears after Sirius Black tries to break into Gryffindor Tower and gouges her portrait. The scene takes place following a Hogsmeade trip, but Harry didn''t sneak into Hogsmeade on this particular day. So I''m assuming the object is something that either Ron or Hermione brought back for Harry. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PLnCm.jpg" alt="*Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* 2003"></p>

<p>My guess is that it''s either a Sneakoscope or a Remembrall. It''s the same shape as the Remembrall from <em>Philosopher''s Stone</em> (film), but it looks like it''s clear and has a black stone rolling around at the bottom while a Remembrall is filled with white smoke that turns red. </p>

<p>In the books the Remembrall is described as marble-sized and the Sneakoscope as being the shape of a top. </p>

<p>It''s definitely not one of the Quidditch balls.</p>

<p><strong>Ron does give Harry a Sneakoscope in the book <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top. There was another note from Ron beneath it.<br><br>
  <em>Harry – this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there’s someone untrustworthy around, it’s supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it’s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn’t reliable, because it kept lighting up at dinner last night. But he didn’t realise Fred and George had put beetles in his soup.</em><br><br>

He warns the upcoming SWAT team that the grenade will go off shortly and they run away.</p>

<p>This question states that the policemen didn''t have enough time to escape the explosion. But I for myself always thought they made it out of the explosion radius in time, but then again, I''m not totally sure about this anymore, since this question says they surely didn''t have enough time as judged by the immediate cut to the explosion destroying the building (although I vaguely remember it to only destroy a single floor).</p>

<p>The reason I''m asking this is, that I think the fact of the policemen dying would bring a major inconsistency with the general moral justification of the heroes'' actions throughout the movie. There are actually no real human enemies in this movie and the movie more than one time elaborates on the fact, that the heroes (and especially the supposedly good <em>Terminator</em>) don''t kill anyone, in order for the viewer to better identify with them on a moral basis. Whereas the previous movie had that touch of sweet immorality, once you decided that it is <em>cool</em> to watch <em>Arnie</em> run around and kill everybody, this one goes to great lengths to show him as a <em>"good guy"</em>, especially in the scene more or less immediately before the questioned one. And in the end most action movies where the hero kills multiple bad guys in a row still try not to show him directly killing innocents.</p>

<p>So I see different possibilities for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The SWAT team didn''t die and managed to escape in time.</li>
<li>Their death is to be justified as kind of collateral damage (in line with all the others killed by the <em>T-1000</em>, the "evil <em>Terminator</em>"), since <em>Dyson</em> didn''t kill them completely on purpose.</li>
<li>Their death is merely ignored or justified with a sense of "the end justifies the means" (which IMHO wouldn''t be in line with the movie''s previous moral elaborations, though).</li>
<li>It is left open for the viewer to decide (which in turn was a bit too <em>"heavy"</em> an aspect for such a straight-to-the-point action movie).</li>
</ul>

<p>And my question is, <strong>did the SWAT team die from <em>Miles Dyson</em>''s grenade, and if yes, how is this supposed to be justified?</strong></p>

<p>(disclaimer: Now it might be that this has been intentionally left open for interpretation which would make this a bit of an open discussion question. But I might also just have overlooked something (or not remebering it that well) or there is even an official statement about this from the writers.)</p>', 1478, 1683, CAST(N'2013-02-05T16:07:45.063' AS DateTime), CAST(N'2014-04-12T23:30:12.743' AS DateTime), N'Did Miles Dyson kill all these policemen?', N'<plot-explanation><analysis><terminator-2>', CAST(N'2013-02-23T18:48:20.313' AS DateTime))

<p>I remember aliens that were large, their bodies made up of thin tentacles (shaped kind of like <em>Cousin It</em> from the Addam''s Family) and one eye in the top center of their bodies.

<p>There was also a woman who I believe was... psychic or magical or something?

<h2>Research : Season One</h2>

<p>Regarding the missing episode "Tick vs. The Mole Men", <a href="http://www.aoltv.com/2006/06/05/about-that-missing-episode-of-the-tick/" rel="nofollow">The Huffington Post</a> says Disney released the following statement: <i></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Due to creative considerations episode 11 (''The Tick vs. The Mole Men'') is not included. However, we hope to include it in future Tick releases." </i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The statement does not further define the "creative considerations".  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060904221331AA8Iurk" rel="nofollow">Yahoo Answers</a> speculates one or more of the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>some (unsubstantiated) rights to the episode are unavailable.</li>
<li>there was a potential lawsuit regarding an unflattering caricature of Cindy Crawford (and her mole) used in the episode.</li>
<li>DVD space constraints restricted size. Disney wanted to fit Season One on 2 DVDs and couldn''t unless an episode was thrown out; "Mole Men" drew the short straw.</li>
</ol>

<p>The author of <a href="http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tick/6266" rel="nofollow">a 2006 article from the website "TV Shows on DVD"</a> purported to have been in contact with Disney / Buena Vista, and had been told the actual reason, but withheld it at the time; he also debunked the Crawford lawsuit rumor. From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... the studio stands by their previous statement that they are working hard to clear "The Tick vs. The Mole-Men" for release on a future DVD set of The Tick ... there''s just an issue with a single episode, and they are dedicated to clearing that matter up, if at all possible.</p>
  
  <p>What IS that issue? We frankly don''t want to share it with the world, because it may jeopardize the situation, and put extra pressure on the parties working it out. ... One thing we WILL say about it, though: we''ve heard ridiculous rumors around the ''net that the hold-up is Cindy Crawford, who supposedly objects to a satire of herself in that episode, called "Mindy Moleford." ... It has nothing to do with her, or that character.</p>
  
  <p>The studio feels pretty good that this will get cleared up in time to be included on a future Tick DVD release as "the missing episode," or something like that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Private e-mail follow-up with "TV Shows on DVD" revealed they no longer recall what the actual reason was behind the "creative considerations".</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: What were the details of the "creative considerations" which ultimately led to the episode not being included in the Season One DVD release or subsequent releases?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Research : Season Two</h2>

<p>No explanation has detailed why "Alone Together" isn''t included with the second season. 
The episode adapts a story from The Tick comic book, which relates a parody of Marvel Comics character Galactus. It could not be due to the Galactus parody, as parodies of other Marvel characters (notably, The Punisher) were spoofed in other episodes collected to DVD.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia article cites a 2006 blog entry by the writer of both omitted episodes, Christopher McCulloch (aka "Jackson Publick", co-creator of The Venture Brothers), stating he has no idea why they are missing.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: What is the specific reason why "Alone Together" was not included in the Season Two DVD release?</strong></p>

<p>I speculate season three was never released to the US due to low sales of the earlier seasons, but I have no evidence to back up this statement. I know <b>I</b> did not purchase either of the first two season sets due to the missing episodes.  The third season was released to DVD in the UK.</p>

  <p>In Thor (2011), Lee appears among many people at the site where Thor''s
  hammer Mjolnir lands on earth. He tears the back off his pickup truck
  in an attempt to pull Mjolnir out of the ground with a chain and
  causes everyone to laugh by asking, "Did it work?".</p>
  
  <p>In Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Lee portrayed a general
  in World War II, who mistakes another man for Captain America/Steve
  Rogers, commenting, "I thought he''d be taller."</p>
  
  <p>In The Avengers (2012), Lee makes a cameo appearance as a random
  citizen in the park asked about the Avengers saving Manhattan. Lee''s
  character responds, "Superheroes in New York? Give me a break", and
  then returns to his game of chess. He also appears in a deleted scene,

It seems entirely plausible Marla Singer materializes to remind Jack he is exploiting these therapy groups. In fact, even when Marla enters she says, "This is cancer, right?" nobody responds.</p>

<p>In addition to the blog, there are three examples of where I can think Marla Singer''s presence is suggested but not required.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Tyler''s confrontation to Marla, he follows her to the laundromat where she removes the clothes from the dryer and proceeds next-door to sell them at a thrift shop. Even though the two are having a conversation in front of the thrift-shop attendant, she does not interject and instead only remains silent with a puzzled look on her face about the talk of bowel cancer. </p>

<p>Does this suggest that overly-civilized and feminized Jack invents Marla, a symbol of his guilt, and steers her toward outlet for his disdain of the order of society? Marla is self-destructive, manipulative, and a kleptomaniac. Whereas later on, Jack invents a hyper-masculine Tyler who is outwardly destructive, blatantly honest and disdains materialism and thus has no need to steal.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Jack''s boss finds some Fight Club paraphernalia on the Xerox machine, Jack says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I''d be very careful who I talked to about this.  It sounds like someone dangerous wrote it... someone who might snap at any moment, stalking from office to office with an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round after round into colleagues and co-workers. Might be someone you''ve known for years... somebody very close to you. Or, maybe you shouldn''t be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the phone rings, and it''s Marla. Since we already know Jack invents Tyler as a way for him to cope with his repression from civilization, it seems like picking up the phone and talking to an imaginary person would use the same set of coping skills that led him to invent Tyler. </p>

<hr>

<p>In the diner after not having seen Marla for an extended period of time, she orders food: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I''ll have the clam chowder, the fried chicken with the baked potato with everything, and a chocolate chiffon pie."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Marla isn''t real, the waiter only responds to Jack''s subsequent request for <em>Clean food, please.</em>, by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In that case, sir, may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know the clam chowder at any of the restaurants is arguably the most contaminated food item. So, it would be logical for the waiter to recommend not eating clam chowder to anybody requesting clean food.</p>

<p>There are many possibilities as to why the waiter says the "<strong>lady</strong>" but it seems like this is the most damning to the theory of Marla''s non-existence. The waiter may be attempting to allude to the fact that Jack isn''t the same person as he is during Fight Club. But it may not be as bad as it seems at first glance, because the waiter doesn''t use the pronoun <strong>she</strong> or <strong>her</strong>. </p>

<p>It is also acceptable to refer to a high-ranking woman to their face as "<em>the lady</em>".</p>

<p>Since Jack even thought to himself --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn''t be talking to the same man. Who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps this is a play on Jack''s lack of masculinity outside of Fight Club, the same way drill sergeants call their recruits ladies. After all, Jack does not want to be a celebrity, he wants to be one of the masses along with his followers.</p>

It sticks out so starkly, I can''t help but feel that it was intentional, for effect.</p>

<p>When I saw it in theaters, I initially thought it was perhaps an allusion to the "spirit" of Ra''s speaking through Bane, or similarly, that perhaps it was the League of Shadows as a whole -- a legion of spirits speaking through the League of Shadows-"incarnate".</p>

<p>After the movie, when discovering that others hadn''t heard or noticed it, I wondered if it was just coincidental, or perhaps just some fluctuation or mismatch of Bane''s voice processing in post-production.</p>

<p><em>Where it is:</em></p>

<p>In the underground sewer scene, when Bane and Batman are fighting, listen to Bane''s lines right after Batman throws the smoke bombs in front of Bane.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BANE: "Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated."  </p>
  
  <p>BANE: "...But we are initiated, aren''t we, Bruce?"</p>
  
  <p><strong>BANE (voice change): "<em>Members</em> of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed <em>us</em>."*</strong>  (emphasis mine)</p>
  
  <p>BATMAN: "..."<strong><em>Us</em></strong>"? <strong><em>You</em></strong> were excommunicated... by a gang of psychopaths." (*See EDIT)</p>
  
  <p><strong>BANE: "I am the League of Shadows..."</strong> (switches to normal voice) "And I''m here to fulfill Ra''s Al Ghul''s destiny!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>++ The YouTube clip is no longer available ++</p>

<p>It sounds so distinct to me, it sounds like a different actor''s voice entirely. </p>

<p>Batman calls out Bane on his "altered"-voice statement where Bane infers that he''s still in full fellowship with the League of Shadows. This could lend credence to Bane actually changing his voice as if it were the League speaking through him, like a legion, or as a spokesperson. </p>

<p>This <em>could</em> be an intentional alteration by Bane himself, or it could perhaps be an "audience-only" subtext or view -- subtly foreshadowing the coming resurgence and "reincarnation" of the League of Shadows through both Ra''s'' appearance and Talia''s (eventual) unmasking.</p>

<p>It definitely doesn''t sound like Ra''s'' voice (Liam Neeson), though, which could''ve made plausible sense (plot-wise) as a foreshadowing or reminder of Ra''s'' "eternal" nature. Although this voice change could similarly be alluding or foreshadowing to a wider scale of the League of Shadows as a whole (if intentional, of course).</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>After rereading and rewatching the scene, it''s now my opinion that the voice change here very likely <em>is</em> intentional, whether in a "conscious" or "subconscious" theatrical vein. </p>

<p>I lean toward it being a subtle, subconscious form of directorial foreshadowing, where it''s not intended for the audience to be consciously aware of or focused on it -- much like the similar "subconscious" foreshadowing of when we first see Miranda and Bruce meet (at the charity ball) -- </p>

<p>Miranda enters the scene covering her face with a masquerade mask (alluding/foreshadowing her deception as "Talia"), as Bruce asks her, "Miss Tate, ...isn''t it?" (she doesn''t answer him, only puts down the mask):</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yIJjV.jpg" alt="Talia''s Foreshadowing"></p>

<p>What makes Bane''s voice change seem too unlikely to be coincidental is that the pairing of the voice change coincides with the <em>precise</em> instance of his dialog where he no longer refers to himself as a <em>singular</em> individual, but rather, as <em>multiple</em> people, a group -- </p>

<p>"<strong><em>Members</em></strong> of the League of Shadows.... you betrayed <strong><em>us</em></strong>"</p>

<p>And even Batman doesn''t let this slip past unnoticed, calling Bane out on it -- </p>

<p>"...''<strong><em>Us</em></strong>''? <strong><em>You</em></strong> were excommunicated..." </p>

<p>...Which Bane then responds by reversing his reference of himself as a singular individual rather than many -- while also coinciding with the "altered" voice suddenly disappearing into the shadows.</p>

<p>Hence, I think I''ll put my money on this being a subtle, "unconscious" foreshadowing for the audience that the League of Shadows is still alive, that it''s <em>not</em> just Bane acting solo.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I''m going to try to reach out to someone involved in the production process, in the hopes of shedding some definitive light on this -- (just for fun, of course) :) I''ll post back any information.</p>', 1391, 1182, CAST(N'2014-03-25T20:32:31.220' AS DateTime), CAST(N'2014-03-25T20:32:31.220' AS DateTime), N'Does Bane''s voice change in this scene because of plot?', N'<analysis><dark-knight-rises>', CAST(N'2013-05-06T18:50:47.140' AS DateTime))

<li>We learn later that the other people are actually robots/androids.</li>
<li>There is a teenage boy in the family who starts to fall for one of the other "people" but gets upset when he finds out she is not really human.  During their "breakup", she makes a comment like, "If you prick us do we not bleed?" and he responds, "Yeah, battery acid!"</li>
<li>The real human family ends up escaping the town, narrowly avoiding the "robot police" who want to "dismantle" them.  </li>

<p>I see that there''s a 1970s newspaper comic strip named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom-Hilda">Broom-Hilda</a> where the titular character is a witch. The name is therefore a pun on <em>Brunhilda</em>. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hY0Hs.gif" alt="Broom-Hilda"></p>

<p>"One day the protagonist''s schoolfriends go on a school trip to the electropower dam that his father designed but he stays behind because he can''t confront it. Mean time on another planet/dimension evil guys unleash a mechanical beast upon the dam. While the beast is destroying the buildings, endangering the people and students, the protagonist senses this and rushes to rescue his friends.
Because he''s actually an alien (royal family) from another planet that the attacking aliens destroyed,
he has the ability to transform/pilot into a giant robot and uses this power to fight the evil beast. He starts to lose the fight against the beast but his friends get contacted by another entity and are granted flying machines/mechas to support their friend. They defeat the beast by redirecting solar beams to power up the protagonist''s mecha."</p>

<p>Other notable facts are.
- The protagonist is the leader of the football team
- the other entity I mention is a pure white man on a pure white pegasus, I think he wields a lance of light.
- the crest of the royal family he descends from is a burning sun.

He tells this to <em>Marty</em> on the next day (or the same night?).</p>

<li><p><strong>And why did <em>Hans</em> leave then?</strong> Was it because he was disappointed by <em>Billy</em> playing such an evil trick on him, or was he disappointed by <em>Marty</em> (and <em>Billy</em>) misusing against him what he told him in trust? Or did he just not believe <em>Billy</em> (or didn''t care) and left for the same reason he initially wanted to leave, because he was fed up with the situation and lost his faith?</p></li>

I enjoyed the character being able to <em>''learn''</em> in action and apply the <em>calm</em> and <em>powerful</em> essence together.</p>

<p>My question is, if any of you experienced folks here know of any similar concepts where the plot attempted to place or extend from where we left off in Meet Joe Black? </p>

<p>My own attempts have lead me to the book trilogy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials" rel="nofollow">His Dark Materials</a> specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amber_Spyglass" rel="nofollow">The Amber Spyglass</a> which takes me to another world and there we experience what it is to be like in that world: in fact those worlds. </p>

<p>I am anticipating that the Hollywood movie of the <em>Amber Spyglass</em> would be siding on the side of a deeper romantic relationship between <em>Lyra and Will</em> - which could destroy the process of experiencing the new worlds.</p>

<p>I welcome any leads from those who have seen <em>Meet Joe Black</em>, <em>felt that connection</em> and seen it <em>repeated</em> in another movie. I just wish someone could lead me on to something that I could <em>entertain myself</em> with that also makes me <em>think</em> and <em>imagine</em> of that <em>specific learning process</em>, at least so my kids can see <em>a modern twist</em> to it that is not too old fashion for them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Must be 90''s or 80''s, I saw it in the early 2000''s in Italy, a country where movies and animes are aired many years after their first release in the West</li>
<li>By the quality it seemed early 90''s or even earlier than that, darker colours, themes and an overall serious tone, very dramatic at times</li>
<li>The main character was a young man, not a teen, hairstyles and such were well, anime, but not dragonball style</li>
<li>The main char and other people, both good and evil, could transform into what looks like a mech, mostly (if not only) wielding melee weapons, colourful energy blasts and such, but were not piloted mechs, they <em>were</em> mech-like after transforming</li>
<li>The enemy masses were composed mainly by huge ammounts of green armored spiders or something similar, swords slashing through them would reveal organic tissue (purple I think)</li>
<li>Battles took place in space, on Earth and possibly on other planets as well</li>
<li>It does look a bit like early-Evangelion</li>
<li>I remember only one significant scene: this woman-mecha character, somehow related to the protagonist, was defeated in battle by two other enemy mech-dudes, placed with her back onto a rock/mountain, her arms crossed on her chest, her hands pinned down onto the rock by two swords (perhaps her own), and she was executed by a powerful red blast. I remember it was <strong>very</strong> dramatic, one of the reasons I still remember this show yet without ever knowing its name.</li>

The character i can remember, there''s a guy who has a gun and a dog who was chasing the person who entered his house. There was also a creepy person who lived in the walls, i think he has some defect with his/her tongue. And there was prisoners under the house.

<p>Serenity (the movie) opens up with River Tam being sprung from the Alliance facility.

<p>However, during the first job, River''s mind reading abilities are well developed and controlled, which follows on well from the last episode of the TV series.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lt. Kafee: Did you order the CODE RED?<br>
  Col. Jessup: YOU ;DDAMN RIGHT I DID!  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is whether the evidence against Colonel Nathan Jessup was sufficient and compact to prosecute him and acquit the two marines?  </p>

<p>During the course of the hearing, it is sufficiently proved that "<strong>Code Red</strong>" is an unofficial disciplinary action conducted at Gitmo. So Col. Jessup says he ordered it.<br>
In the confrontation between Kaffee and Jessup leading up to the above dialogue, Jessup froth about the rigid chain of command within the Armed Forces with "<strong>We follow orders or PEOPLE DIE</strong>". That a Marine officer will not &amp; cannot ignore his superiors orders under any circumstances.<br>
In the movie, the court takes this bit of information(i will not call this confession) and combines it with Code Red confession in order to prosecute Jessup. The Code Red practice is confirmed by many witnesses, but this <strong>"rigid chain of command"</strong> is not proved or endorsed by anybody other than Jessup. So it must stand as his interpretation that a superiors officers orders will never be ignored &amp; will always be followed and not a fact and therefore not a confession.   </p>

<p>So even though I as a viewer in a theater want to "Punch in the face" Jack Nicholson for his amazing portrayal of Colonel Nathan Jessup, how can an unbiased court in the film prosecute him with the evidence at hand.    </p>

<p>Also, Code Red doesnt mean an order to kill</p>

<p>Also, what kind of punishment was he likely to get after his conviction?  </p>

It then becomes clear that he has been doing this in his personal life as well as on stage - each brother leads ''half a life'', sometimes appearing as Borden and sometimes as Fallon. This is how he completes the illusion: one Borden goes into the first door, the other Borden emerges from the second door a moment later.</p>

<p>Angier doesn''t know how Borden does the trick. He follows what he believes to be a ''clue'' in Borden''s notebook and travels to Colorado to meet Nikola Tesla, who Angiers believes can build a machine that can help him perform the trick.

However, the final pages of the notebook reveal that Tesla was merely a red herring, designed to get Angier out of Borden''s way for a long time. Tesla, it turns out, had never built such a machine before.</p>

<p>At this point, Tesla agrees to build Angier''s machine anyway. Instead of building a machine that transports matter, he builds one that duplicates it. Angier uses this machine in his act, but in order to avoid multiple Angier clones cluttering up the place, one of them has to die as part of the act.</p>

<p>This all makes sense, so far, but I don''t buy the idea that Borden''s use of the word ''Tesla'' as the key to his cipher is random.

<p>However, there''s a decent amount of evidence that the story as told from the hero''s point of view is not the whole story:</p>

<ul>
<li>The film goes out of its way to show the aliens as non-hostile from the start. They only attack military targets, either when provoked or when it''s necessary to further their objective.</li>
<li>The camera is very quick to cut away when it appears that a defenceless target is being attacked, meaning the audience never gets to see what happened.</li>
<li>Every violent act committed by the aliens is in response to aggression from the humans. (In response to a comment, I''ll concede that firing into traffic at Pearl Harbor is a hostile act. However, by the time this happens, the humans have already escalated hostilities, so it''s not like it was completely unprovoked).</li>
<li>The protagonist constantly makes mistakes and escalates hostilities at every opportunity. He actually botches the entire first contact mission, starts a war, gets huge numbers of innocent people killed, and also kills all of the aliens. At the end he is lauded as a hero despite all this. (Not to mention that the aliens were <em>invited</em> to Earth in the first place).</li>
<li>Every time we see an alien''s face, the alien is looking scared, panicked or threatened. This includes shots of the aliens on land and in their ships.</li>
<li>The aliens have multiple opportunities to kill the protagonist (and many others) and spare their life every time. </li>
</ul>

<p>In short: peaceful aliens come to Earth after receiving a signal from humanity. Their communications ship hits something in orbit and crash lands. They attempt to use a communications satellite to phone home, but are assaulted from all sides by the hostile natives.</p>

<p>The subtext here is so blatant that it can''t possibly be unintentional. However, I can find no reference to this anywhere (presumably because the movie was panned by critics so no-one took it seriously).</p>

<p>I guess I have a few questions with this in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>The central assumption is that the aliens are trying to access the communications satellite to summon reinforcements for a hostile invasion. Is this ever explicitly stated in the film? Or is it simply an assumption made by an unreliable character?</li>
<li>Is this reading of the text supported by the text itself, or have I missed something important?</li>
<li>Has anyone involved in the making of the film ever alluded to this potential subtext?</li>

Possible his wife i.e. the hero''s mother was dead. The father is either an archaeologist or he has a hobby of coin collecting because I remember in their first meeting the father was cleaning some coins from some box. The girlfriend tries to communicate with the father. But he talks too small, but it was depicted, given the mental condition the father possesses, the initial amount of talking with the girl was not that bad.</p></li>

Later she requests the father to visit her family so that the father can return the confidence of talking and meeting with strangers. Before going there, all the three persons the hero, girlfriend and his father was having breakfast in the house. In the dining table while eating, the father starts loosing the confidence again. At the end of breakfast, the father almost starts being reluctant to go there. Despite that, the other duo compels him to ride the car and go with them.

Much of the plot involves Steve McGarrett attempting to retrieve the body of a fallen Navy SEAL comrade from North Korea. The episode includes many flashbacks, including McGarrett and his friend as Navy SEAL''s in training and on a mission. From the beginning of the new Hawaii Five-0 series, Steve McGarretts back-story was that he is a former Navy SEAL.</p>

<p>However, in the "current" time, McGarrett is seen wearing an Army uniform, as seen in the photo below (the woman beside him is wearing the comparable Navy uniform). I''ve checked several show-specific wikis and can''t find any reference to him ever being associated with the Army. All references are to his Navy SEAL background.</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with Akira Kurosawa''s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yojimbo_%28film%29" rel="nofollow">Yojimbo</a> has most likely also seen Sergio Leone''s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fistful_of_Dollars" rel="nofollow">A Fistful of Dollars</a>.  Whether you watched them because they are the same story, or you found that out afterwards... or you just liked them independently, you would have noticed that although they <em>are</em> the same story, there are details that are different between them.  Now, Walter Hill directed a Bruce Willis film called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Man_Standing_%28film%29" rel="nofollow">Last Man Standing</a>, which is also the same story as those other two.  There are specific nods to both previous versions.  Nods such as...</p>

<p>Bruce stops and spins a bottle when he hits a fork in the road, to determine which way he is going to go.  This is a variant on how Toshiro Mifune throws a stick in the air to decide which way he is going to go when he hits a fork in the road in the beginning of Yojimbo.  Clint Eastwood faces no random chance/indecision and performs no action to choose the way he is going to go before he gets to the town where all the action happens.  So, the Nod is in Last Man Standing, to Yojimbo.</p>

<p>Bruce faces thugs when he arrives who assault his car.  Clint Eastwood faces thugs who harass his mule.  In Yojimbo, Toshiro Mifune is on foot, so the Nod is from Last Man Standing, to Fist Full of Dollars.</p>

<p>After being captured, Clint is assisted in his escape by being hauled off in a coffin.  In Yojimbo, Toshiro escapes the same way at the same point in the story.  Bruce however, is taken away in a car.  So this Nod is in Fist Full of Dollars, to Yojimbo.</p>

<p>I''ve never seen The Glass Key, but all three of these movies are based on it.  One of the differences between it and all the others though, is that Alan Ladd who plays the character playing both sides against each other, is actually loyal to Brian Donlevy... while in the later three films, the protagonist is loyal to neither side.

<p>A friend was asking me about this. Naturally I assumed with a few Google searches I''d be able to turn it up, but this has been astonishingly difficult.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nothing on FX''s site seems pertinent.</li>
<li>Wikipedia turns up nothing.</li>
<li>The series'' official soundtrack was released before Season 4 was released, so no good there</li>
<li>Turning on subtitles on Netflix <em>does</em> reveal the songs lyrics, which is particularly interesting given how muffled they are. I don''t know how this data works - obviously in, e.g., in a pirated series, the subtitles may be made by the pirates themselves. But I know nothing of this metadata or whether it might be possible to purchase the episode in a digital form and find other metadata residing with the song.</li>
<li>The credits on Netflix seem irrelevant. This surprised me because I thought the song would require, you know, being credited. The series is 5-10 years old so may predate modern business models, in which it''s clearly <em>not</em> to the advantage of the producer to obscure the origin of the song (conversely here I am advertising the series, but I''m guessing this is not the thinking, even if it arguably should be). Some producers involved in sound and music were listed. I could possibly try them on LinkedIn but that sounds like beyond a last resort.</li>
<li>Shazam was not able to determine it on a few tries.</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel this information should be somehow researchable / trackable. And obviously it is via social networking but that sounds like a very uphill battle.

  <p>I have no idea what he''s talking about.</p>
  
  <p>Play it as cool as you like, Fonzie. But we all know you''ve been following my
  client day and night. The poor man can''t even spend a few minutes with his
  granddaughter without you guys quivering in the bushes and peeping through
  your little binoculars. It''s-- Well, it''s disturbing. And it''s taken a toll on
  his mental and physical well-being.</p>
  
  <p>Your client looks fine to me.</p>
  
  <p>Well, some hurts only show on the inside. Now, you guys don''t even have
  warrants for these tails, do you?</p>
  
  <p>Theoretically, these tails you refer to would be completely within the bounds
  of the law. We don''t need a warrant to follow somebody through a public place.
  Theoretically.</p>
  
  <p>Yeah, that is, uh, theoretically correct. However, I would counter that an
  open-ended, unrestricted surveillance like this amounts to stalking. Which is
  illegal. Now, I don''t know what it is you find so interesting about my client,
  and I''m not here to judge. Different strokes and all. But sadly, he''s just not
  that into you. So, I have filed for a temporary restraining order against the
  DEA on behalf of Mr. Ehrmantraut.</p>

  <p>You know who likes this suit? Judge Papadoumian. She thinks I''m a snappy

  citizen. Sorry. Expect a visit from the sheriff, agents. You should have your

  if Ehrmantraut wants a fight, he''s gonna get one.</p>

Now I also see that most questions were answered, even though some questions are still left for debate.</p>

<p>One question that I do wish the producers had given a more satisfactory answer to, though, is the connection between Eloise Hawking and MIB''s loophole.  When Locke leaves the island, he is told by Christian Shephard (i.e. MIB), to find Eloise Hawking in Los Angeles.  Eloise is then later paramount in ensuring that the loophole works in that she is insisting that the coffin with Locke''s body must be on board the Ajira-flight, thus providing MIB with his "vessel" for completing the loophole.  These two facts made me think that perhaps Eloise somehow was cooperating with MIB, but this is never really confirmed, and since we know that MIB can not leave the island, this means that MIB must have "recruited" Eloise before she left the island. But if this is the case, how could MIB know about his loophole-plan years before it manifested?  Does MIB perhaps have contact with somebody else off the island who could relay information to Eloise?  Or is it perhaps possible that Eloise really had no contact with MIB, and simply insisted Locke''s body had to be on the Ajira-flight in order to have a "substitue" for Christian Shephard''s body which was on Oceanic 815?  Or was she somehow manipulated by MIB without her knowledge through some way never seen on the show?  </p>

<p>So in the beginning of the movie, we have Hades coming to the celebration of Hercules'' birth. It is very clearly established that he does not like Zeus, at all. But Zeus seems happily oblivious; he''s glad his brother is there, he jokes around with him, tells him he should stay at the party longer and not work so hard. So we''ve established, then, that Hades does not like Zeus at all, but that Zeus doesn''t know this, and however often they see each other, he likes his brother and thinks they have a good enough relationship to invite him to the celebration of his son''s birth.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to the scene on Mt. Olympus after Pain and Panic have just failed to kill Hercules. Zeus and Hera wake up to find baby Hercules missing from his crib...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods on a frantic search. But by the time they found the baby, it was too late. Young Herc was mortal now. ... But Zeus and Hera wept because their son could never come home. They''d have to watch  their precious baby grow up from afar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay. So, I am totally able to accept that "all the gods" here refers to <em>all the gods on Mt. Olympus</em>, which would be all of them except Hades. So Hades did not participate in the search for Hercules—fair enough, I buy that.</p>

<p><em>However</em>. At some point, one of the gods on the search found Hercules ("But by the time they found the baby, it was too late.") At this point, all the gods on Mt. Olympus (so, all except Hades) now know that Hercules has been found, and Zeus and Hera watch baby Hercules with his new mortal parents, and are sad that he can''t come back to Mt. Olympus.</p>

<p><em>At some point during the next 18 years,</em> <strong><em>no one</em></strong> <em>talked to Hades about this?</em></p>

<p>I find this very, very hard to believe. All the other gods don''t like him; fine, I can accept that they wouldn''t have told him (or spent much time with him). Hades doesn''t leave the Underworld often, so he wouldn''t have spent much time on Mt. Olympus and heard it by accident—I can buy that too. </p>

<p>But Zeus is his brother. He''s just had a baby, and a huge party celebrating that baby''s birth where he invited his brother and tried to get him to stick around longer. If you have a brother who you care enough about to make jokes and invite him to the baby''s party etc.... Then you''re going to go visit that brother and tell him in person that your baby has been kidnapped and lost his immortality, and that you''ve lost your only chance to ever raise your son. I think you''re going to go tell him <em>pretty darn quick</em>, actually, because you''re upset and grieving and want your family''s support. But setting speed aside—at some point within the next couple of days, you''re going to tell him. Of <em>course</em> you are. Who wouldn''t?</p>

<p>I just find it very hard to believe that Hades managed to go 18 years without hearing the slightest whisper of the most awful tragedy to rock Mt. Olympus since...well, probably the Titans. There was only one baby god up there. This would have been a pretty big deal. Yet somehow Hades manages to get through the next ~18 years without finding out until Hercules rescues Meg from the River Guardian.</p>

Why didn''t they all look humanoid from the get go. Why did it take 4.6 billion years, to go all the way through invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, apes to finally get to the ultimate goal of resembling the engineers. 4.6 billion years is stupendously long time for a species to remain the same, physically, technologically, culturally and ideologically.</p>

<p>Perhaps the idea is that many branches of science such as biology, paleontology, paleobotany, geology, etc, were thrown out by this new discovery, and life on earth is much much younger than the evidence suggests. </p>

<p>Alternatively, they came just a few million years ago and their DNA just mixed with apes, who already happen to look similar to engineers (and have compatible biochemistry) by a totally remarkable example of convergent evolution.</p>

When asked by <em>Logan</em> for the reasons she says that <em>Mariko</em> always had problems making friends. So it seems she was taken with them because she made friends with <em>Mariko</em>, which <em>Shingen</em> puts a bit more cold-hearted when he says something along the lines of (forgive me for not being word accurate):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are a toy doll, a companion for a child who has outgrown you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which sounds a bit cold (and seems to be what <em>Yukio</em> thinks secretly, too), but sounds reasonable given that <em>Yashida</em> seems like a man that takes and gets whatever he wants.</p>

<p>But likewise is <em>Yashida</em> depicted right from the beginning as a man that fears his own death above all other things (even if this is emphasized more heavily towards the end). And from a story viewpoint <em>Yukio</em>''s mutant power to predict other peoples'' deaths doesn''t serve much more than to classify her even more as an outcast (and maybe to raise the tension by falsely predicting <em>Logan</em>''s death).</p>

<p>So are there any hints that she wasn''t "adopted" just because to provide a friend to <em>Mariko</em>, but for <em>Yashida</em> to constantly have someone around him who could warn him of his death? And was this an additional device to emphasize his constant fear of death and thus another hint to his actual plans? Or am I just overinterpreting things here.</p>

Unfortunately, it is owned by an old pastor who doesn''t want the site to be built into a hotel. So the builder comes with a dirty trick (not known to the man who wants to build the hotel). He tells the pastor he wants to build an orphanage house instead. He bribes the pastor''s lawyer not to tell the pastor about the plan.

<p>In general, I don’t write reviews because I find it to be frustrating enough to watch them in the first place, let alone spend <em>extra</em> time to write <em>about</em> them. That said, I occasionally do write reviews for shows or movies that I either really love or really hate.</p>

<p>I watch television shows and movies of all genres and dates, but I am not fond of reality-shows because they cheapen the art and work.</p>

<p>These days, I find that most of the movies I watch tend to be in the summer when television becomes "light" because during the TV season, I just don''t have the time, what with at least 10 hours per night on average.</p>

<p>Thankfully, when the VLC (VideoLan Client) video-player changed their speed setting so that it only affects the tempo instead of the pitch of the audio, it became possible for me to watch videos at high speed. Now I find it difficult to watch even things I <em>like</em> at less than 130%, let alone junk that I don''t want to watch (depending on what it is, I have managed to successfully watch some things as fast as ~210% before it becomes unwatchable!)</p>

<p>I also manage my never-ending, ever-growing list by having things I don''t care about running on TV or in the corner of the monitor while I work on other things.</p>', 49, 13, 1)

<p>I am a <a href="http://football-talk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/donkey.jpg" rel="nofollow">developer</a> at <a href="http://www.anite.com/businesses/travel" rel="nofollow">Anite</a>, working in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net-mvc">ASP.NET MVC</a> from the early CTPs through to MVC4 at present.</p>

<p>For over a year, my .NET skills were blunted by the necessity of working almost exclusively in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coldfusion">ColdFusion</a>. Still, it gave me chance to get to know MVC a lot more through <a href="http://www.mach-ii.com/" rel="nofollow">Mach-II</a>. When ASP.NET MVC came out, I felt I had a good advantage, and had would have a stronger knowledge than if I had continued using ''classic'' ASP.NET webforms.</p>

<p>I enjoy the fact that stackoverflow is more community based than Experts Exchange, which really makes Users feel isolated.</p>

<p>Also, I''ve answered more questions in the two months here, than I did in five years at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=experts+exchange+scam" rel="nofollow">Experts Exchange</a>.</p>

<p>Initially spurred on by the challenge of "doing better than <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/Users/261677/jonathon-bolster">Jonathon Bolster</a>", I found that helping out is extremely enjoyable and helping people of all technical skill levels is great fun.</p>

<p>Please note that I am <strong>not</strong> currently looking for further employment. :)</p>', 0, 0, 0)

2.  A traditional rule governing the case of personal pronouns after forms of the verb to be  is that the nominative or subjective form ( I; she; he; we; they ) must be chosen. Some 400 years ago, owing to the feeling that the postverb position in a sentence is object rather than subject territory, me  and other objective pronouns ( him; her; us; them ) began to replace the subjective forms after be,  so that It is I  became It is me.</p>

  <p>I’m a 39 year old autodidact, and very proud to be.   I''m looking for work
  right now, but that''s normal given my proclivity for accepting contracts. I write, I eat,
  and I enjoy life with all of the gusto I can.  I love language and
  languages.  I occasionally slip and use serial commas, and when I do I
  often leave them as a flag flying in the face of my enemy, Language
  Prescriptivism.  I’m a native English speaker and I’ve studied both
  Latin and several Romance Languages that are derived from it. I’ve
  studied law, language, history, sociology, logic, debate, math and
  various sciences, because those subjects all fascinate me to no end.</p>

<p>Feel free to stalk my Internet name(s) if you wish - it''s how I make most of my closest contacts these days. Just note that I don''t really believe in social constructs when they get in the way of satisficing (or in the way of my goal of learning as much as possible). </p>

<p>Don''t take anything I say/do too seriously.  A lot of the things I do (that may look weird/stupid on the outside) are the types of things that help me adjust my posterior probability of various things - especially low probability events.Sometimes I hit on a jackpot/very interesting idea. I''m kind of messy since it helps facilitate creative destruction.</p>

<p>I have <em>a lot</em> of respect for <em>all</em> of the sciences. Tactically, I''m developing heuristics for rationality, impartiality, anti-laziness, and creation+identification+searching for what''s relevant+reliable. Strategically, I just want to learn everything.</p>

<p>A lot of my thought processes involve my creating new hypotheses and refuting them on my own. I still document the thought process since it''s important and may be important for future "true" hypotheses.</p>', 0, 0, 0)

<p>Well talking about myself I would prefer saying I am a tech enthusiast added with a flavour of creativity. I grew up sketching and playing with colours since childhood hence I am a great lover of art and creativity and as the time passed I grew a great association with computers which brought a technological revolution in me.</p>

<p>My engineering degree fueled my growing interest in technology and introduced me to the world of Robotics. I also love designing and developing web pages as it satisfies both my interests i.e, computers and creativity.</p>

<p>In free time I like twisting my lappy (my 1st and only GF) with various software and try to go more deeper in to the world of computers. Sometimes books also become my good friend and few writers which I prefer are S. Sheldon, V. Seth, and C. Bhagat.</p>', 0, 0, 0)

<p>I am very passionate about discovering new technologies, using different coding languages, playing guitar, and solving crazy challenges making me feel like my head is going kablooey!</p>

<p><strong>Further information about me:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I like SO''s spirit: sharing knowledge about different computer/software topics, and learning from each other. Also, I like trying to help SO Users in difficulties 8). </li>
<li>I really like traveling and discovering new cultures and learning other languages. Sometimes, I like the taste of adventure trips, where I don''t really pay too much attention to the place where I''ll be going, and where I finally find myself walking in the snow reaching my knees (or skating on the ice) for a whole day, with my old, faithful, and wet pair of sneakers :).</li>
<li>I''m a guitar and a ukulele player who loves listening to music everyday. I''m open to any kind of music... well, except for Techno / Rave... :S</li>
<li>I have an download speed of 20kB/s, and my upload speed is worst (2x slower maybe...). Actually, I still don''t know why I''m providing this information... I guess I''m currently making a wish to obtain a faster internet connection XD...</li>

<p>I have practical and professional experience in C#, SQL (Oracle, MS, MySQL and *Gres), ASP.Net, ASP, C++, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, XML/XSD/XSLT, Cold fusion and Python. I''ve developed in many different arenas; from Support software to Business operations to Financial services to Demo coding.</p>

<p>To me, Software development and the commitment to it as as much a lifestyle as a career choice; in my personal experience, the best and most motivated (and sometimes most genius) coders are the ones who''ve taught themselves as much as anything else; people for whom programming doesn''t stop at 5pm in the evening, hell - people who often don''t stop coding until 5am.</p>

<p>In fact, the kind of people who are still on Stack Overflow at 2am when they need to be up for work in 5 hours, because they can''t rest until they''ve solved <em>that problem</em>.</p>

<p>So; I''ll try to answer questions when I don''t have a confident basis in the subject area, because learning the answer is just as important as understanding the question.</p>
